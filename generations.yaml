    description: "The INFINITI QX55 is the brand's first coupe-SUV, designed as a spiritual successor to the FX series that pioneered the segment in the early 2000s. Based on the QX50 platform but featuring a dramatically sloping roofline and fastback profile, it combines crossover utility with sports coupe styling. The exterior design incorporates INFINITI's signature double-arch grille, piano key LED headlights, and a distinctive character line that rises toward the rear, creating muscular proportions. Powered exclusively by a 2.0L VC-Turbo four-cylinder engine—the world's first production variable compression ratio engine—producing 268 HP and 280 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered through a continuously variable transmission and standard all-wheel drive across all trim levels. The interior shares much of its design with the QX50, featuring a dual-screen infotainment system with 8-inch upper and 7-inch lower touchscreens, available semi-aniline leather seating, and open-pore wood trim in higher specifications. Despite the coupe roofline, rear headroom remains adequate for adults, though cargo space is reduced compared to the QX50. Standard safety and driver assistance technologies include forward emergency braking, predictive forward collision warning, and available ProPILOT Assist semi-autonomous driving features. As INFINITI's entry in the growing luxury coupe-SUV segment, the QX55 competes with established models like the BMW X4 and Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe, offering distinctive styling and the unique VC-Turbo technology as key differentiators in a competitive market."
